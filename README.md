- :technologist: You have software that doesn't work.
- :bed: You're up at night turning, unable to sleep, tirelessly, wistfully dreaming about a world where defaults are sane.
- :test_tube: You believe deployment shouldn't require a dedicated team.
- :wrench: You look forward to projects where examples exist and documentation is clear. 

Welcome!

:muscle: I aim to make software that rejects mediocrity to enable people to do great things!
